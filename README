*Proceeds to help someone*
git status, then git add . this command

sweet did everyone get to this stage cool
now to add it to our repository you do
git oh sorry
so now were going to commit our changes
to do that you do git commit -m for message then you ahve to put your message inside
first git repositor initialized you can really put anything you want here but for your sanity put a meaningful message here since if you happen to find a problem you should really see what went wrong
